          The album contains 10 songs with various musical genres such as
          hip-hop and R&B. Artists with different characteristics such as Gaeko,
          sunwoojunga, lIlBOI, and sogumm joined the album to add more variety
          to the music. Not only did MINO write and compose all 10 songs, but he
          also took part in the arrangement process to show his ability both as
          an artist and a producer.
